Short demo of the TextMeshPro vertex and color deformations

This is a small example of animating the color and position of individual vertices of a TextMeshPro game object inside of Unity. It was built during a one-week workshop at [ENJMIN](https://enjmin.cnam.fr/enjmin/ecole-nationale-du-jeu-et-des-medias-interactifs-accueil-1126103.kjsp), a national video game school in AngoulÃªme, France.
